4. Reflection
#Write a short note (200–300 words) on your experience, what you learned, and any
challenges faced.

This exercise was actually quite challenging for me. I am aware that it is probably really basic, but since it is my first time doing this kind of work, I was really confused and struggled a lot with following the directions. I took me a lot more time than I anticipated, but nevertheless, I pushed through, and I believe to have understood the basic concept of how it is supposed to work. But I will have to practice more in order to feel familiar and comfortable with using Git’s core features, GitHub collaboration, and branching.
